  builds a puzzle from a solution backwards

  1. starting with a grid, the width of the playboard, but only a few rows in height.
  2. drop a square of 9 cubes, as if unexploding a bomb.
      the placement of the 9 cubes doesn't have to lie completely within this grid.
      cubes falling outside of the grid will just be forgotten.
  3. do this several times in random places, within that grid.

  the number of times we cycled step 3 becomes the "Par" of bombs needed to complete this level.
